WELCOME TO THE DUNGEON!
You are a wanna-be adventurer, sick of your daily chores,
trying to escape your crummy day-to-day life at the farmers market.
Well-fed and with glistening eyes, you join other adventurers in search
of a cave filled with treasure, which, as told by the town wench, used to belong
to the infamous troll-master that reined over the uncivilized land next to your city.
You find yourself going through damp and dark swampy hellholes, joined by other
adventurers as eager as you are to be victorious or die trying...
