YOU WIN
You defeated the Troll master in his own abode!
After a moment of respite, you and your fellow companions take all
the loot you can find amid the carcasses of fair maidens used for
food and fun by the Troll King and his cronies. After the long way
back to the surface, the first beam of light hits your face. It's a
beautiful morning, and you feel like you just conquered the harshest
ordeal of your whole life. Not just up to now, but for the rest of it.
You will never forget this feeling.
THANKS FOR PLAYING!
